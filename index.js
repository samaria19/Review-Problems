//First, declare variable named firstName.

//Assign firstName to a string value of your first name.

//Declare another variable named lastName and assign it the value of your last name.

//Then declare another variable named fullName and assign it to the current value of firstName and lastName and have the joined values separated with a space character.

//Remember that computer languages will not add the space character for you so how would you do that manually?

//Numbers
//Declare a variable named luckyNumber.

//Assign luckyNumber to a number of your choice.

//Declare another variable named luckyNumberTimes2 and assign it the value of luckyNumber multiplied by 2.

//Booleans
//Declare a variable named myBool and assign it the value of true.


//Then, declare another named isEqualTo and assign it the value of strictly comparing luckyNumber and luckyNumberTimes2.

/* 
1. Create a function factorial that when given a 
number, returns the factorial of it. The factorial
 of a number is the product of an integer and the 
 integers below it.


What are factorials? 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial

For example:
factorial(1); // => 1     (1)
factorial(2); // => 2     (2 * 1)
factorial(3); // => 6     (3 * 2 * 1)
factorial(4); // => 24    (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
factorial(8); // => 40320 (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
